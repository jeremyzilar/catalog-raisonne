# Artwork template

This is to be the template for artworks in the Catalog Raisonne. Once we have a working data template, we can build out a HTML template to render this data on a page.

## Defining the data

In our template, each data point is defined by a `key/value` pair. In this example, `artist` is the key, and `"Johannes Vermeer"` is the value.

**Example**

```
artist: "Johannes Vermeer"
artwork_title: "The Allegory of Painting"
year_created: "1966"
```

### Rules

- **keys** need to be lowercase, start with a letter and use underscores to separate words
- **values** are strings of text that need to be included in quotes (see the example)

## Draft template

- `artist`: "Johannes Vermeer"
- `artwork_title`: "The Allegory of Painting"
