# Artwork template

This is to be the template for artworks in the Catalog Raisonne. Once we have a working data template, we can build out a HTML template to render this data on a page.

## Defining the data

In our template, each data point is defined by a `key/value` pair. In this example, `artist` is the key, and `"Johannes Vermeer"` is the value.

**Example**

```
artist: "Johannes Vermeer"
artwork_title: "The Allegory of Painting"
year_created: "1966"
```

### Rules

- **keys** need to be lowercase, start with a letter and use underscores to separate words
- **values** are strings of text that need to be included in quotes (see the example)

## Draft template

- `artist`: "Johannes Vermeer"
- `artwork_title`: "The Allegory of Painting"
- `year_created or conceived`: "1966"
- `CR_inventory number`:

# example: "0004-2011-March_Couple_Ink_Drawing_on_Paper_OOK"

- `overall_artist_mount_size`: "27 x 23 inches | centimeters"
- `initial_inner_medium_support_size`: " 12 x 9 inches | centimeters"
- `year/date_1st_documented`: "2018"
- `registered_copyright_with_library_of_congress`: "pending"
- `copyright_group_number`: "1234567910111212_pending"
- `special_notes` :

# special notes woudl include "must have non-reflective protective glass", or "must be viewed in a DARK blacked room under UV light only: any special instructions the artist expects, " work was revolve at 1 RMP every 30 seconds"

# above are the most important listings for a printed out version of a Items CR listings

# There are other items that should be in the CR...

# such as documented locations and travel events,

# holding of the Pre- and Post- examination reports and photographs

# I would say these documents would be held in a REPOSITORY separate for the CF, along with Insurance documents and Gallery history and contracts.
