# Artwork template

This is to be the template for artworks in the Catalog Raisonne. Once we have a working data template, we can build out a HTML template to render this data on a page.

## Defining the data

In our template, each data point is defined by a `key/value` pair. In this example, `artist` is the key, and `"Johannes Vermeer"` is the value.

**Example**

```
artist: "Johannes Vermeer"
artwork_title: "The Allegory of Painting"
year_created: "1966"
```

### Rules

- **keys** need to be lowercase, start with a letter and use underscores to separate words
- **values** are strings of text that need to be included in quotes (see the example)

## Draft template

- `artist`: "Johannes Vermeer"
- `artwork_title`: "The Allegory of Painting"
- `year_created or conceived`: "1966"
- `CR_inventory number`:

### example: "0004-2011-March_Couple_Ink_Drawing_on_Paper_OOK" ; every artist ussally starts with a numbering system, but it is really a confusing way to list, I have met many artists, and they say: I have a little book, or that is not really finished yet, there are millions of works by artists that were picked up after they died, and the family say the artist made it, but there is no number, not title, not record. If a work is made/ completed in the month of March, and it is one of three works in that month of March, I would say: "0004-2011-March_Couple_Ink_Drawing_on_Paper_OOK" The three character "ook" is my code for (one-of-kind) and I have written that on the reverese of many of my own works of art. everyone is different. the Livign artist might think their work os 'OOK' and never been made before in the history of art, but it sure can be documented with some sort of NFT or Crypto, but how long will that last? All of these CR should be printed out into hard copy, and sent to protective areas. such as the Library of Congress.

- `overall_artist_mount_size`: "27 x 23 inches | centimeters"
- `initial_inner_medium_support_size`: " 12 x 9 inches | centimeters"
- `year/date_1st_documented`: "2018"
- `registered_copyright_with_library_of_congress`: "pending"
- `copyright_group_number`: "1234567910111212_pending"
- `special_notes` :

### special notes woudl include "must have non-reflective protective glass", or "must be viewed in a DARK blacked room under UV light only: any special instructions the artist expects, " work was revolve at 1 RMP every 30 seconds"

### above are the most important listings for a printed out version of a Items CR listings

### There are other items that should be in the CR...

### such as documented locations and travel events,

### holding of the Pre- and Post- examination reports and photographs

### I would say these documents would be held in a REPOSITORY separate for the CF, along with Insurance documents and Gallery history and contracts.
