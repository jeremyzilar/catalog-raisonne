  <h1>Introduction to building a Catalogué Raisonne
  </h1>
  <h2>Having a Control, an Inventory, of works af art
  </h2>
  <h3>A simple way would be by Date the work was signed; however that are many ways list and present a collection.
  </h3>
  <h4>This does not necessarily mean when the work was completed on such Date
  </h4>
  <h4>The works in any collection need to be located and cross referenced
  </h4>
  <h4>On a side note: I prefer spelling 'Catalogue' {the British way vs. the American way: 'Catalog'}
  And Raisonne..The term catalogue raisonné is French, has a meaning "reasoned catalogue" (i.e. containing arguments for the information given, such as attributions), but is part of the technical terminology of the English-speaking art world. The spelling is never Americanized to "catalog", even in the United States. The French pluralization "catalogues raisonnés" is used.

    <h1>To begin building a Catalogue Raisonne, start with a listing: artist name, date and size
    </h1>
    <h2>Make notes of any information such as location, history, provenance

  <p><em>In bed we <strong>concocted</strong> our plans for the morrow.</em> But to my surprise and no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been diligently consulting <em>Yojo—the name of his black little god—and Yojo had told him two or three times over, <strong>and strongly insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in harbor, and in</strong> concert selecting our craft; instead of this,</em> I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order to do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though it had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg.</p>

  <p>I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of Yojo’s judgment and surprising forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.</p>

  <p><big>Now, this plan of Queequeg’s</big>, or rather Yojo’s, touching the selection of our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little relied upon Queequeg’s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that trifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom—for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; how it was I never could find out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I never could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles—leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three ships up for three-years’ voyages—The Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod. Devil-Dam, I do not know the origin of; Tit-bit is obvious; Pequod, you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes. I peered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.
