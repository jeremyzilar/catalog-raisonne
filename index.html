        <h2>
          There are many ways list and present a collection. A simple way would
          be by the date the work was signed; or the type of work material such
          as works on paper or paintings; or subject.
        </h2>
        <h3>
          This does not necessarily mean that the actual work was completed on
          such date. Perhaps it was concived on such a date, and it was
          completed or cast many years later, even 50 years later. The works in
          any artists collection need to be documented, located and cross
          referenced.

        <p>
          On a side note: I prefer spelling the word 'Catalogue' which is the
          British way vs. the American way: 'Catalog'and Raisonné..The term
          catalogue raisonné is French, has a meaning "reasoned catalogue" (i.e.
          containing arguments for the information given, such as attributions),
          but is part of the technical terminology of the English-speaking art
          world. The spelling is never Americanized to "catalog", even in the
          United States, the French pluralization "catalogue raisonné" is used.

          To begin building a Catalogue Raisonné, start with a listing: artist
          name, date and size

          Make notes of any information such as location, history, provenance,

            >In bed we <strong>concocted</strong> our plans for the morrow.</em
          >
          But to my surprise and no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to
          understand, that he had been diligently consulting
          <em
            >Yojo—the name of his black little god—and Yojo had told him two or
            three times over,
            <strong
              >and strongly insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going
              together among the whaling-fleet in harbor, and in</strong
            >
            concert selecting our craft; instead of this,</em
          >
          I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should
          rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in
          order to do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to
          myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as
          though it had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must
          immediately ship myself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed
          great confidence in the excellence of Yojo’s judgment and surprising
          forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a
          rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole,
          but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, this plan of Queequeg’s, or rather Yojo’s, touching the selection
          of our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little
          relied upon Queequeg’s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to
          carry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances
          produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and
          accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined
          rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that
          trifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up
          with Yojo in our little bedroom—for it seemed that it was some sort of
          Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with
          Queequeg and Yojo that day; how it was I never could find out, for,
          though I applied myself to it several times, I never could master his
          liturgies and XXXIX Articles—leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his
          tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of
          shavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After much prolonged
          sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three
          ships up for three-years’ voyages—The Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the
          Pequod. Devil-Dam, I do not know the origin of; Tit-bit is obvious;
          Pequod, you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated tribe
          of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes. I peered
          and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit;
          and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for a
          moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.
