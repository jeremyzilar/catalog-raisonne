        <h1>Introduction to building a

        <h2> 
          It is important to keep records; even very basic notes. It sounds simple, but it is very diffecult. There are many ways organize a list and present a collection. 
          A simple way would be by the date the work was signed; or the type of work material such as works on paper or paintings; or subject. 
        </h2>
        <h3>This does not necessarily mean that the actual work was completed on such date; perhaps it was concived on such a date but completed or cast until years later. 
          The works in any collection need to be documented, located and cross referenced</h3>
        <h4>Do not expect perfection; as with many published Artist Catalogue Raisonnes they are incomplete or worse, have discovederd known false claimed works.  
          Nothng is better than having the artist make and record their works in their lifetime. Picasso had is famious Vervos volumns start5ed when he was in his 50s. and he likely was only hafe done making works. 
          It is said he made over 50,000. Warhol: over 150,000. Imagine that, Warhol foundation is only up to Volumn 5.

        <h5>The Steps-to-Producing a catalogue 
          Photos-so many photos, the more detailed the better.
          Inspection notes-measurments, materials, conditions, how the works should be mounted and displayed, varnish or coatings 
          Collection data-provinance, where has it been. 
          </h5>
        <h6>The more techinical the 'survey examination' work is done early, the better, however it can ve overwhelming; so to begin is better. The more you have written down, the easier it will be to go back and add.
          Know this, there will always be more additions.
          </h6>
        <p>On a side note: I prefer spelling 'Catalogue' {the British way vs. the
          American way: 'Catalog'} And Raisonne..The term catalogue raisonné is
          French, has a meaning "reasoned catalogue" (i.e. containing arguments for
          the information given, such as attributions), but is part of the technical
          terminology of the English-speaking art world. The spelling is never
          Americanized to "catalog", even in the United States, the French
          pluralization "catalogue raisonné" is used.</p>
        <p>If you are the Artist, living today, there is no time like the present to make a list. If you are in charge of a collection of an artist: an Ovuror:  (Find defintion)
          The process is so much more difficult. and should never be considered complete; there is always ammendments additions comments to consider.

        <p>To begin building a Catalogue Raisonne, start with a listing: artist name, date, and size.

        <p>Make notes of any information such as location, history, provenance, below is an example numbering system</p>

        Note1: With the two works above: One was in the in the two gallery shows in
        California, and is currently in SLC with SWB. It is in a beautiful
        Artist mount I made by myself, my own hand made frame with $$$
        Non-reflective plexi. It still needs the inventory number placed on the
        back .0001.The other work needs to be located and numbered).
      
        Note2: In my case, I always sign the works as I make them, ussually on the front 
      lower edge. I also consider the HAND made mounting as part of the work, and always 
      expect the work to be under glass. Real glass, Double layered, UV-protected, and non-rreflective. 
      Otherwise, they can not be shown. ( use LARGE sheets of 4mm or 6 mm the highest Quality Optiom for the works travling 
      larger than 36 inches. My frames would be design to hold the GLASS far away from the face of the works ( deep Fillits). 
      The works on paper, should NEVER be hinged, do not use adhesive on the backs. 
      
      Note3: Notice above, I being the Artist have certain conditions of how my works should be handled. they are my works. 
      I can only hope collectors and curators/registars/directors/galleryist/art-handlers/shippers/ and the most important -framers;
      all respect and read the instructions. I will have lables and hand written instructions on the back of each work.

      <em>In bed we <strong>concocted</strong> our plans for the morrow.</em>
      But to my surprise and no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to
      understand, that he had been diligently consulting
      <em
        >Yojo—the name of his black little god—and Yojo had told him two or
        three times over,
        <strong
          >and strongly insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going
          together among the whaling-fleet in harbor, and in</strong
        >
        concert selecting our craft; instead of this,</em
      >
      I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest
      wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order to
      do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself, I,
      Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though it had
      turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship myself,
      for the present irrespective of Queequeg.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great
      confidence in the excellence of Yojo’s judgment and surprising forecast of
      things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good sort
      of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did
      not succeed in his benevolent designs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, this plan of Queequeg’s, or rather Yojo’s, touching the selection of
      our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little relied upon
      Queequeg’s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and
      our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon
      Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set
      about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor,
      that should quickly settle that trifling little affair. Next morning
      early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom—for it
      seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting,
      humiliation, and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; how it was I
      never could find out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I
      never could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles—leaving Queequeg,
      then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his
      sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After much
      prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were
      three ships up for three-years’ voyages—The Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and
      the Pequod. Devil-Dam, I do not know the origin of; Tit-bit is obvious;
      Pequod, you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated tribe of
      Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes. I peered and
      pryed about the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and
      finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and
      then decided that this was the very ship for us.
